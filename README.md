# TODO's: 
(this is more of a thing for me than anything, but whatever lmao)
- add settings
- error handling
- client-side download history preview
- custom download paths

quote from `main.cpp`:

```
I have never ever used imgui nor have made any real serious c++ programs, i just graduated OOP C++, and all
of this library, make, ifdef and whatnot stuff scare the shit out of me but atleast i hope it works....
and i hope that i dont have to use chatgpt much here lol!

also that means im keeping all comments from the copypasted imgui tutorial, so bear with me on that one.....
