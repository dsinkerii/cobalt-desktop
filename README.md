in very huge wip, i dont have much time to work on it atm, sorrey

is my first c++ app, uses imgui and maybe more stuff

quote from `main.cpp`:

```
I have never ever used imgui nor have made any real serious c++ programs, i just graduated OOP C++, and all
of this library, make, ifdef and whatnot stuff scare the shit out of me but atleast i hope it works....
and i hope that i dont have to use chatgpt much here lol!

also that means im keeping all comments from the copypasted imgui tutorial, so bear with me on that one.....
